# Code Challenge 2
- I forked the repo from the directions and cloned the it onto my local directory by using the green "code" button, copied the code and pasted it into my command line after $ git clone.
- After recieving the "done" message, I checked my project folder to make sure the repo was cloned.
- After making sure I was in the "code-challenge-2" directory, I entered "code ." to open it in VS Code.
- Next, I began to edit, juxtaposed with the google homepage.

### Modifications to HTML
 - I used the begining HTML from Dele as a model to finish the rest of mine.
 - From his layout, I  realized I should lay out the boxes that I needed to replicate Google.
 - Dele already completed the Nav Bar and from that, I saw one large div container with two containers (right and left) that had their items inside.
 - From there I created a div container for the middle section or "main" as I called it, with-in that div I had an attribute referencing the google logo picture I saved and I had to adjust the width because the image was too large
 - With-in that same div, I added another container for the search box and another that contained the search buttons
 - I then used Dele's Nav example to create a footer section for my replica and had one larger div container with two containers for the right and left sides with their items as attributes.

 ### Modifications to CSS
 - Then using the ids/values I created from the elements in my HTML, I started to edit the CSS file using flexbox to put things where I wanted them to go as best as I could.
 - When I did get stuck, I would inspect elements on the actual Google and see how each line contributed to the display and how I could troubleshoot on my own CSS file.
 - I did find the tip of using a border box around each container so you could really visualize how the containers were displaying and what was being changed as I modified the values.


 ## This was definitely a challenge and lived up to the assignment name, fun!
